One limits the overall property tax payment to a certain percentage of the propertyâ€™s market value. Another type restricts mill levies, or freezes mill levies.

The revenues from this tax are used for transportation purposes. Besides state authority, the local government needs a local law or voter approval to implement the local option gas tax.

Besides state authority, the local government needs a local law or voter approval to implement the local option sales tax. To be considered a local option sales tax in this study, the tax must be implemented and collected by a county and used for transportation or for general purposes, including transportation.
